# Business Analytics Using SQL

This is a mini-project to showcase the types of queries that can be done with standard ANSI SQL. 

## Country Club Database

For this case study I'll use a read a database held in PHPMyAdmin: an open source administratio tool for MySQL and MariaDB. However, I downloaded the database an stored it on the *databases* folder in this repo.

In this case study, I'll use MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, Juptyer Notebook, and SQLite to tackle a series of challenges on a database containing information about a country club. For this case study, I'll show you  what a database looks like on a nice interface like PHPMyAdmin, and connect to a local instance of the database using Python and SQLite. Data scientists use these methodologies to do work on a daily basis. The main objective of this mini-project is to retrieve particular pieces of information and translate requests into SQL queries.
